This element provides a general-purpose neuromorphic processor core. It performs standard leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) dynamics for simulated neurons, and exchanges spike messages between neurons. Currently, this core is standalone. An upcoming release will add the ability to connect cores via standard network elements.

:::info

This element has been interchangeably referred to as "gensa" and "GNA". A naming change to consistently use "gensa" is under way. Once the codebase is updated, this documentation will be updated to reflect the change as well.
