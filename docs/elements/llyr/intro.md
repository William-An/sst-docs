title: llyr
---
The *llyr* spatial component is a highly configurable compute array capable of instantiating processing elements
(PEs) whose behavior can model simple Boolean gates or complex logic such as transcendental functions or any
type of compute that user would like to model. The PEs are connected via a simple direct-connect network. The
function and connectivity of the PEs are specified via a user-supplied input file that places no limits on the
size, connectivity, or composition of the compute fabric.
